## Gap-Closure Judgment

**Status:** Closed.

My gap is closed because I now understand that the problem in my Conversion Engine is not just whether the agent succeeds or fails at booking a meeting, but whether the system can attribute the failure to the correct stage of the pipeline. Before this explainer, I was thinking about the scheduling flow as a sequence of actions: classify reply, look up HubSpot contact, generate Cal.com link, draft reply, and send through Resend. I now understand that this is not enough for a production agent. Each step needs to emit a typed trace record with its input, output, status, latency, error type, and responsible component. The concept that closed the gap for me is step-level failure attribution: a failed scheduling outcome should not collapse into “booking failed.” It should be classified as model misclassification, bad tool arguments, HubSpot/Cal.com/Resend runtime failure, stale CRM state, orchestration failure, missing fallback policy, or final delivery failure. With a trace schema that records the model-visible state, selected action, tool arguments, tool results, retry path, final response, and business outcome, the warm-lead scheduling path becomes auditable instead of opaque.
