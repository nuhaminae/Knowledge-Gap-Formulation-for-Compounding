# Morning Call Summary

During the morning call, we clarified that the original draft question was mixing three related but different issues: SimPO β, the target reward margin, and the model’s PASS bias on disqualification tasks. The ambiguity was that the repo describes the model as SimPO-style, but the actual training script uses TRL `CPOTrainer` with `CPO_BETA = 2.0`, so the question needed to distinguish SimPO theory from the implemented CPO configuration.

We sharpened the question around the concrete Week 11 artifact: `training/train_simpo.py` and the preference-pair construction in `training_data/build_simpo_pairs.py`. We agreed that the real gap is not simply “what is β?” but whether PASS bias should be solved by changing β, adding a SimPO-style target margin, or tuning the inference PASS threshold.

The revised question now asks how preference-loss mechanics translate into false PASS behavior on disqualification tasks, and what diagnostic sweep would reduce that bias without damaging the judge’s overall calibration.
